In this assignment, a random password generator was created

When I click the button to generate a password
Then a prompt is created asking the user to input a length between 8 and 128 characters for the password
If the user doesnâ€™t input the proper length, nothing happens
When inputting a number between 8 and 128, 
Then a series of prompts for password criterias are generated
First prompt is whether to include lowercase letters
If confirmed, lowercase letters are included in the random password
Else, lowercase will not be included
Second prompt is whether to include uppercase letter
If confirmed, uppercase letters are included in the random password
Else, uppercase will not be included
Third prompt is whether to include numeric values
If confirmed, numeric values are included in the random password
Else, numeric values will not be included
Last prompt is whether to include special characters
If confirmed, special characters are included 
When all prompts are answered
Then a random password is written to the page, meeting the requirements defined in the prompts
